Introduction
Welcome to the clandestine lair of Fraglre Berg. This project is extremely hush-hush—no peeking, no squeaking. If you’ve stumbled here by happenstance, we strongly advise a swift retreat lest you be whisked away to the comedic dimension of the unknown.

Objectives
Code with Caution: We do big, mysterious things here, but remain discreet.
Innovation: Twist your mind around the realm of the improbable.
Security: Guard these secrets with your life (or at least with a well-fortified password).
Guidelines & Confidentiality
Whisper, Don’t Shout: Any conversation about this project is strictly on a need-to-know basis.
No External Sharing: Under no circumstances should these docs or any bits of the code be shown outside the sacred circle of the initiated.
Locked Doors & Encrypted Channels: If you must talk about it, ensure all communications are heavily encrypted, or done in a soundproof library guarded by ninjas.
Version Control: If using Git, ensure this project is in a private repository, accessible only by authorized personnel. No public forks or cameo appearances.
Minimal Metadata: Watch out for logs, commits, or comments that reveal top-level secrets. Keep commit messages obscure and riddling if you must: “Added weird stuff #1”, or “Strange function fix for… that thing.”
Who May Access
Fraglre Berg Core Team: The handful of shadowy figures who do the daily coding, testing, and muttering incantations of secrecy.
Approved Collaborators: A short list of folks who have proven their unwavering loyalty to the cause (and possibly performed bizarre oaths under a full moon).
Designated Goblins (optional): If you have top-tier clearance and a bizarre sense of humor, you may bring in code “minions” to help with menial tasks. They, too, must sign the Non-Disclosure Spell (NDS).
Contact & Questions
Keeper of Secrets: keeper@fraglreberg.example
24/7 Subterranean Hotline: (555) FR-AGL-RE1 (if you dare)
Emergency Portal: In case of code meltdown or comedic infiltration.
If you have any doubts about whether something can be shared, the answer is probably “No, keep it in the vault.” For all else, contact the Keeper of Secrets at the top of the nearest mountain peak at midnight.

Disclaimer: This README is not to be disclosed, reproduced, or recited under a full moon without explicit permission from the rightful overlords of Fraglre Berg. Failure to comply may result in unstoppable giggles, random visits from suspicious top-hatted inspectors, or the dreaded “401 Access Denied” in the real world. Stay vigilant, friend!

Now hush... and code on.
